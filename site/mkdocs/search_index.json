If you have a handful of fundable items to import we can walk you through the process of using our web interface. You\u2019ll be able to add the details online and preview them to make sure everything is ready to share with the world.\n\n\nHave more than a few and need to import by csv? Our development team can load several fundraisers, sponsorships, or trips directly to the database and set them in preview mode for your review. Typically we recommend 3-4 weeks prior to launch or prior to donation imports. This allows plenty of time to review all items and allow for changes if you\u2019d like to make any tweaks to your final product. The reference id assigned or provided for these fundable imports will be used in recurring donation imports and a completed import is required before moving monthly online donations. You can visit our fundraiser, trip, and sponsorship import guides to prepare your data.\n\n\nUser / Donor base\n\n\n(2 weeks before transitioning online payment processors)\nPrepare user transition, if applicable. See our importing user guide for required fields and instructions on preparing for user import. Users should be imported before any recurring donations or merchant processor transitions go into effect.\n\n\nOnline card processing\n\n\n(30-45 days ahead of the time you want to receive payments through Pure Charity)\nPCI (Payment Card Industry) Compliance requires that when moving from one web-based online card processor to another the transfer of that data must go from one merchant to another. Since there are a few more moving parts with this transition, the timing of the move will be important and should be planned at least 45 days ahead of the time you want to end service with your current provider.\n\n\nCustomer Relationship Management\n\n\nPrior to moving your donor base over we will review your current CRM setup and help make sure your data continues to integrate easily. We provide an optional user reference id that can be used by your organization to connect with a primary key used by your existing CRM.
