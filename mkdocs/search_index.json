If you have a handful of fundable items to import we can walk you through the process of using our web interface.

Our development team can load several fundraisers, sponsorships, or trips directly to the database and set them in preview mode for your review.

This allows plenty of time to review all items and allow for changes if you\u2019d like to make any tweaks to your final product.
