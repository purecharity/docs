#### Pure Charity API Documentation

###### How do I get an API key?

You can request an API key for your organization by contacting our support team at help@purecharity.com. Weâ€™ll ask you about the following needs to make sure you are assigned just the right team members to make your launch with Pure Charity a success.

- Will your organization need help installing the plugins?
- Is your organization hosting their own integration or are hosting services needed?
- Do you need help purchasing a domain name or managing DNS services?
- Will your organization need to import currently active users or recurring payments to transfer?
- Does your organization have currently active fundraisers, trips or sponsorships to move over?
- Can we provide check handling services or ACH integration for you?
